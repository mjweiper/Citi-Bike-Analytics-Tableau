# Tableau - Citi Bike Analytics

The purpose of this assignment is to aggregate data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, analyze that data, and find two unexpected phenomena. The questions I wanted to take a look at were if Co-Vid 19 had affected the popularity of the bike share program and diving into what specific demographic primarily used the bikes.

I pulled this data from the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage and used 2 data sets (July 2019 and July 2020) to take a closer look!

## What was the comparison between July 2019 and 2020?








**Next, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Use your visualizations (does not have to be all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
* The dashboards should be accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring. 

**City officials would also like to see one of the following visualizations:**

* **Basic:** A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* **Advanced:** A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

* The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up unveiling any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

**Finally, create your final presentation**

* Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
* This is what will be presented to the officials, so be sure to make it professional, logical, and visually appealing.
